_An image kernel is a small matrix used to apply effects like the ones
you might find in Photoshop or Gimp, such as blurring, sharpening,
outlining or embossing. They're also used in machine learning for
'feature extraction', a technique for determining the most important
portions of an image. In this context the process is referred to more
generally as "convolution".
